First, I created a combined dataset.
    
    --Why? (a) There are many files being combined, and it got confusing in Tableau. For example, every file had latitude/longitude.
            If I needed to plot the hospitals, I had to make sure I was grabbing lat/long for hospitals instead of
            parks, rail stations, affordable housing, etc. By combining the data sets in Python, I could give each column a name that 
            described which data set it belonged to (e.g., all the hospitals have '(H)' appended to each column name).
            
            (b) It gave me an opportunity to filter to the relevant columns before importing to Tableau.
            
            (c) It's an easily repeatable process. For example, if you have to start over on the Tableau workbook, you would need to
            load the raw data, perform all the joins, and then rename the columns, clean the data, etc., vs. just re-running this 
            Jupyter notebook.
            
    --What? The output is a single CSV which combines the data for: crime, affordable housing, hospitals, police stations, and rail stations.
    
    --How? Using the Filter_Crime_Data.ipynb in this repository
    
    --NOTE: the crime data set is too big to be stored in this repository, so you will have to download a version from the city of
            Chicago website to run it. Link is listed in the Jupyter notebook.
            
Then, I loaded into Tableau. 

    --How? (a) Connect to data source: Combined_Data.csv (the output of Filter_Crime_Data.ipynb). Important--double click on the 
            'Combined_Data.csv' table...this should pull up a "logical" table, which is the only way to do a join (instead of a 
            relationship), which is needed for joining the lat/long to the shapefile.
    
            (b) Connect to second data source: CPD_Parks_0919.zip. This is the shapefile downloaded from the city of Chicago website.
            
            (c) Drag 'CPD_Parks_0919' to join it with the first data source. You should see a venn diagram (if not, and it just
            draws a line, then make sure you double clicked on the 'Combined_Data.csv' label first. For the fields to join, do a
            calculated field on the left: MAKEPOINT(['Latitude'],['Longitude']). Select Geometry on the right. And make sure to
            change the "=" to "intersects." This will connect the data to the shapefile, which allows everything to be plotted.
            
            (d) Add another data source: Chicago_Population_Counts.csv. Because we're doing crime rates per population, we need this file.
            For the connection, connect the zip code of the shapefile (believe it should be called Zip1) to the zip code of the
            population file. Note: you may have to convert one or both to a string by using a calculation: "STR([Zip])" or similar.
            
            (e) Click the 'x' to close out the logical table with the venn diagrams. You should now just see "Combined_Data.csv." 
            Now, you'll need to connect to the parks data, which is another shapefile. Since it has zip codes (unlike the crime data),
            you don't need to use the venn diagram / "intersects" method. You can just drag it in and set the zip codes equal.
            
Then, it was just a matter of doing some calculations within Tableau to get everything to work properly. See Chicago_Crimes.twbx
            on my Tableau Public page.
